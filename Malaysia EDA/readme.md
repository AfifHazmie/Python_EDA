## ðŸš€ Case Study: Intructions

Your submission will be evaluated using the following criteria:

* Dataset must contain at least 5 columns and 1500 rows of data
* You must ask and answer at least 5 questions about the dataset
* Your submission must include at least 5 visualizations (graphs)
* Your submission must include explanations using markdown cells, apart from the code.
* Your work must not be plagiarized i.e. copy-pasted from somewhere else.

Follow this step-by-step guide to work on your project.

### Step 1: Select a real-world dataset 

- The Malaysian dataset must be used for your case study.
- The dataset is available at:
  * [Portal Data Terbuka Malaysia](https://www.data.gov.my/data/ms_MY/dataset)
  * [Department of Statistics Malaysia](https://www.dosm.gov.my/v1/index.php?r=column3/accordion&menu_id=amZNeW9vTXRydTFwTXAxSmdDL1J4dz09)
  * [data.world](https://data.world/datasets/malaysia)
  * [Dataportal.asia](https://dataportal.asia/dataset?vocab_economy_names=Malaysia)
  *[knoema](https://knoema.com/atlas/Malaysia/datasets)
  *[The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/country/MY)
  * [Dataset Search - Google](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
  * [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)
  * [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
  * [Awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
  * [Datahub.io](https://datahub.io/collections)
  * [Earthdata](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/)
  * [CERN Open Data Portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/)

### Step 2: Perform data preparation & cleaning

- Load the dataset into a data frame using Pandas
- Explore the number of rows & columns, ranges of values etc.
- Handle missing, incorrect and invalid data
- Perform any additional steps (parsing dates, creating additional columns, merging multiple dataset etc.)

### Step 3: Perform exploratory analysis & visualization

- Compute the mean, sum, range and other interesting statistics for numeric columns
- Explore distributions of numeric columns using histograms etc.
- Explore relationship between columns using scatter plots, bar charts etc.
- Make a note of interesting insights from the exploratory analysis

### Step 4: Ask & answer questions about the data

- Ask at least 4 interesting questions about your dataset
- Answer the questions either by computing the results using Numpy/Pandas or by plotting graphs using Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Create new columns, merge multiple dataset and perform grouping/aggregation wherever necessary
- Wherever you're using a library function from Pandas/Numpy/Matplotlib etc. explain briefly what it does


### Step 5: Summarize your inferences & write a conclusion

- Write a summary of what you've learned from the analysis
- Include interesting insights and graphs from previous sections
- Share ideas for future work on the same topic using other relevant datasets
- Share links to resources you found useful during your analysis

### Step 6: Make a submission

- Upload your notebook to github.
