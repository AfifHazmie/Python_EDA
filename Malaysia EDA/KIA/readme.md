The dataset is about the state election held in 2018. It is taken from Kaggle and we are going to analyse the dataset to see the performance of the parties involved in the election. We will be asking ourselves some interesting questions to help us coming up with data visualizations such as bar chart, pie chart, line chart and more. For this analysis, we will be using the Python language with the help of libraries such as mathplotlib, pandas, seaborn, numpy and much more.
